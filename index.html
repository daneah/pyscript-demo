      <h1>PhillyPUG demo</h1>

      <p>
        This page is initially served via FastAPI.
        The content of the page uses a PyScript custom plugin to define a custom element that enhances the page content.
      </p>

      <py-config>
          plugins = ["/client/responsive_image.py"]

          [splashscreen]
          enabled = false

          [[fetch]]
          files = ["/client/pylit.py"]
      </py-config>


      <h2>Default behavior</h2>
      <p>
        The following image is a default <code>img</code> tag.
        The default browser behavior displays images at their native size, so this image likely flows off the page unless you have a large monitor.
      </p>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/2000x100" alt="A placeholder image" />

      <p>
        The following image is also a default <code>img</code> tag.
        Because images are displayed at their native size, this image is likely narrower than your browser unless you have a small monitor or mobile device.
      </p>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1000x100" alt="A placeholder image" />


      <h2>Behavior with PyScript-defined element</h2>
      <p>
          The following image is also an <code>img</code> tag, but it's wrapped in a <code>responsive-image</code> custom element.
          The custom element is defined in PyScript and makes the image responsive so that it will shrink to fit its container.
          To avoid a flash of unstyled content, content of custom elements that aren't yet defined are initially hidden via CSS.
      </p>
      <responsive-image>
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/2000x100" alt="A placeholder image" />
      </responsive-image>


      <h2>Behavior with PyScript-defined element and property</h2>
      <p>
          The following image is also wrapped in <code>responsive-image</code>, but has the <code>grow="true"</code> attribute.
          This image will both shrink and grow to fit the container, even when the container is larger than the native resolution of the image.
      </p>
      <responsive-image grow="true">
          <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1000x100" alt="A placeholder image" />
      </responsive-image>
